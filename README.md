Solution for 2 consecutive absent days

Explaination :

for n days:
n-1 ways  P (nth day) { if present on nth day, any combination will work for previous n-1 days}

Let's divide problem for "Absent" scenario on nth day

n-2 ways P A(nth day) { if present on n-1th day, any combination will work for previous n-2 days}
n-3 ways P A A(nth day) { if absent on n-1th day, present on n-2 day ,any combination will work for previous n-3 days}


Solution for 3 consecutive absent days

Explaination :

for n days:
n-1 ways  P (nth day) { if present on nth day, any combination will work for previous n-1 days}

Let's divide problem for "Absent" scenario on nth day

n-2 ways P A(nth day) { if present on n-1th day, any combination will work for previous n-2 days}
n-3 ways P A A(nth day) { if absent on n-1th day, present on n-2 day ,any combination will work for previous n-3 days}
n-4 ways P A A A(nth day) { if absent on n-1th day, absent on n-2 day ,present on n-3 day, any combination will work for previous n-4 days}
